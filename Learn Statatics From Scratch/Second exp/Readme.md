# Project Title: Statistical Analysis of Housing Data

## Introduction

This project provides a comprehensive statistical analysis of housing data using Python. The code is designed to explore and summarize key characteristics of the dataset, including:

* Descriptive Statistics
* Skewness
* Correlation Analysis
* Standard Deviation

The project aims to uncover insights and patterns within the housing data that can be valuable for further analysis or decision-making.

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3:** Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can check by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal.
2. **pip:**  The Python package installer, pip, should be included with your Python installation.

### Installing Dependencies

1. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):** It's good practice to create a virtual environment to isolate the project's dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```
2. **Activate the Environment:**
   * **Windows:** `env\Scripts\activate`
   * **macOS/Linux:** `source env/bin/activate`
3. **Install Requirements:** Install the required libraries from the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Script

1. Ensure you're in the project directory (where the `run.py` file is located).
2. Execute the following command:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```
   Or, if your system defaults to Python 2:
   ```bash
   python3 run.py
   ```

## How to Create a Requirements File (requirements.txt)

A `requirements.txt` file lists the project's Python dependencies and their versions. Here's how you can create one:

1. **Activate your virtual environment (if using).**
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```
   This will capture all installed packages and their versions.

## Example `requirements.txt`

```
pandas
numpy
scipy
```

This file would specify that the project needs the `pandas`, `numpy`, and `scipy` libraries to run correctly.

**Key Points:**

* **Virtual Environments:**  Strongly recommend using virtual environments to avoid dependency conflicts with other projects.
* **requirements.txt:** This file is essential for reproducibility and ensures anyone can easily set up your project.
