# Statistical Analysis with NumPy, Pandas, and Python

This project demonstrates how to use NumPy, Pandas, and Python's statistics module to calculate various descriptive statistics on a dataset. It provides a simple example of how to analyze data using these powerful libraries.

## Experiment Overview

The core experiment in this project involves:

1. **Data Loading:** We use Pandas to create a `Series` object, which is essentially a single column of data. You can easily replace this with your own dataset loaded from a CSV file or other sources.

2. **Statistical Calculations:** We utilize NumPy, Pandas, and the `statistics` module to calculate the following:
   - Mean (Arithmetic Mean)
   - Median
   - Mode
   - Standard Deviation
   - Variance
   - Sorting
   - Minimum and Maximum values
   - Harmonic Mean
   - Geometric Mean
   - Percentile
   - Skewness

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-url.git
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv  # Create the environment
   source venv/bin/activate  # Activate it (Linux/macOS)
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # Activate it (Windows)
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Script

Make sure your virtual environment is activated. Then, simply run:

```bash
python3 run.py
```

This will execute the `run.py` script, which performs the analysis and displays the results in your terminal.

## Customizing the Data

Feel free to replace the sample data in `run.py` with your own dataset. You can load it from a file or create it manually within the script.

## Additional Notes

- This is a basic example. You can expand it to handle more complex analyses and visualizations.
- Consider using a Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration and reporting if that suits your workflow better.

**Key points about Markdown:**

- **Headings:** Use `#` (h1), `##` (h2), etc., for headings to structure your document.
- **Code Blocks:** Enclose code snippets in backticks (\`) for inline code, or use triple backticks (\`\`\`) with language specification (e.g., \`\`\`bash) for code blocks.
- **Lists:** Use `-` or `*` for unordered lists, and numbers for ordered lists.
- **Emphasis:**  Use `*` or `_` for italics, and `**` or `__` for bold text.
- **Links:** Format links as `[link text](link url)`.
